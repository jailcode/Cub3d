# Description
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which is
considered the first FPS ever created. It offers an opportunity to explore ray-casting.

cub3D shows a dynamic view inside a maze, where the first person character can move around in all four directions (forward, backward, left and right) and independently from the horizontal movement look in any direction (left, righit, up, down).
All changes in position and direction of view can be combined by pressing multiple keys and/or moving the mouse.
